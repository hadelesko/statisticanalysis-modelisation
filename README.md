# statisticanalysis-modelisation
Statistical analysis based on sensor-data to determine if the modelisation is possible. The first part of the analysis was focussed on the identification of the groups of persons presenting most insignificant difference in order to build find the suitatable models describing the specified motions during picking process. My tasks in this project were coding somes Matlab functions to mappe the data, proceed the descriptive statistics and variance analysis, to record and interprete the results of the analysis.
